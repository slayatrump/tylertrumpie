					<h1>Who I am</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="box box6">
					<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am Tyler Trumpie.  I am currently enrolled in a 3 year bachelor degree in computer science with a specialty in game design and simulation at Davenport University.
					<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have always been fascinated by technology, but didn't pursue the field until my first programming class in my sophomore year of high school, Java Programming I.
					<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ever since that Java class, I have been interested in the ins and outs of coding.  I decided to go for game design because games give people not only an
					escape from real life, but for some a job as a streamer, a passion for a career, or just another way to be entertained.  Video games have been constantly evolving, and I have been 
					along for the ride, hoping to take the wheel and drive home a new game that will leave an impression on anyone who plays it.  I don't study game design because I think it is a good career, 
					I study game design because it is a great career for <u>me</u>.  I am following my dream, and I am excited to see where it takes me.
					<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you would like to contact me, email me at tylertrumpie@gmail.com.</p>

					<h1>Personality</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="box box6">
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a guy that lightens the mood, be it through funny comments or making a fool of myself.  I love to make others know that they are loved and known by at least someone.  
							I am a people pleaser; I find joy in making others happy.  That plays a huge role in my work ethic.  I want to make something that will bring joy into whoever sees it.
							<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;My creativity works off of a foundation.  Whenever an idea is presented to me, I can bring up the mechanics, characters, levels, and skill needed for the game. 
							I love to theorycraft, be it a new game, balancing a mechanic, or adding something new to an existing game.

					<h1>Interests</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="box box6">
						<p>
							&nbsp; &nbsp;I love programming and logic, which made me choose my career path in computer science. 							
							<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; I love video games, not just as a hobby, but also as a way to spark my brain with creative ideas.  For instance, I find myself taking a look at existing mechanics 
							in a game and dreaming up ways in which that mechanic could be more interesting or integral to a specific playstyle.
							<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mechanics creation and testing is another interest I discovered in high school.  The rewarding experience after successfully 
							implementing a mechanic I thought was impossible or very difficult is something that pushes me along this career path.
